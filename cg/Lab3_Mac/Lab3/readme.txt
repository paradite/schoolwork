Method modified:
display()
main() - added generateSmallParticlesParams() to randomize positions for small particles
main() - added GLUT_MULTISAMPLE for anti aliasing

Coolest thing:
Composite object 1 is called "a sheet of pills".
Composite object 2 is called "a pill that has been spilled".
Small particles in Composite object 2 look like they have been spilled out.
Metallic effect for the primitive objects
