== General Notes about this assignment ==

Indexing: 
A corpus is first generated by reading files in reuter folder. Stemming and 
case-folding is then performed on each token to produce terms that will be stored
in dictionary together with the associated document frequency. Postings list is
generated with raw term frequency of the term in each document.

Another document named "doclength.txt" is generated to store the document lengths
of each document for length normalization during searching.

Searching:
Dictionary and document lengths are read into the memory from the respective files. 
Each query is then processed sequentially, ranking each document in the collection
with lnc.ltc ranking scheme. The top ten result for each query is generated into 
the specified output file.
