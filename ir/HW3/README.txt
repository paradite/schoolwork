== General Notes about this assignment ==

Indexing: 
A corpus is first generated by reading files in reuter folder. Stemming and 
case-folding is then performed on each token to produce terms that will be stored
in dictionary together with the associated document frequency. Skip pointers are generated
on-demand during the search phase. The decision to store both files as text instead 
of binary format improves readability and allows us to use line number as pointer to posting list.

Searching:
The query is first parsed into expressions, where expressions comprises of either a token or
a list of expressions (i.e. expressions are recursively defined)
Then these expressions are recursively searched to return the corresponding postings list,
in the case of an expression with a list of expressions, the list of expressions are firstly ordered according
to both the size estimate of the postings list and the boolean precedence. Then each expression 
in the list is searched sequentially according to the order, with the postings list result being merged recursively
with the next expression in the list.

A tailored procedure for boolean query parsing and execution were coded by ourselves, and we did not rely on any external libraries or standard alogrithms.
